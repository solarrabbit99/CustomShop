#   IMPORTANT: Do not change this manually unless you are  #
#   absolutely sure of the location of the target chest.   #
#   Use the `/setcrate` command for the plugin to write    #
#   onto this instead. Delete value for world to render    #
#   location ineffective.                                  #
