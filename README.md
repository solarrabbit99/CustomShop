### Vending Machines

A shop design used only for selling items with 27 available slots. The shop is
capable of selling various kinds of items at once, each with its own price.

### Newt's Briefcase

A shop that is able to hold virtually as much item of the same type as you want
(the real limit being Java's Integer.MAX_VALUE, 2 147 483 647). This shop can be
used for selling and buying at the same time.

### Salesman's Deal

A shop capable of selling items at an offer of a discounted price if the
purchase exceeds a certain quantity (e.g. 1 for $10, 10 for $90).
